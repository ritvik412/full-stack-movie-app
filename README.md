## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ritvik412/full-stack-movie-app.git
cd full-stack-movie-app
```

### 2. Backend Setup
- Navigate to the backend/ folder:
  ```bash
  cd backend
  ```
- Install dependencies from shell:
  ```bash
  npm install express mongoose dotenv cors
  npm install --save-dev nodemon
  ```
- Create a .env file in backend/ with your MongoDB credentials:
  ```bash
  MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
  PORT=5000
  ```
    - Note: Never commit your `.env` file! It is already listed in `.gitignore`
- Add a start script to `package.json`:
  ```bash
  "scripts": {
  "start": "node server.js",
  "dev": "nodemon server.js"
  }
  ```
- Start the backend server in development mode:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
  The server will run on `http://localhost:5000` by default.

### 3. Frontend Setup
- Navigate to your frontend folder
```bash
cd ../frontend
```
- (Optional) Install a static server globally:
```bash
npm install -g serve
```
- Start the static server or open directly:
    - **Using `serve`**:
    ```bash
    serve .
    ```
    - **Directly**: Open index.html in your browser.
- Configure API endpoints:
  
    - In `movie.js`, set TMDB_API_KEY to your TMDB API key.
    - In `script.js`, set REVIEWS_API_URL to your backend URL, e.g.:
      ```bash
      const REVIEWS_API_URL = "http://localhost:5000/api/reviews";
      ```

# Testing your MongoDB CLuster:

- You can test your mongoDB database by running curl commands through your shell.
- Copy the backend dev url and then run a test review :
  ```bash
  curl -X POST your_dev_url/api/v1/reviews/new -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"movieId":13, "user":"raymond" ,"review":"very good movie"}'
  ```
    - Here we have used POST request to feed the information to our database, we can also use GET,PUT,DELETE,etc for          their respective purposes.
